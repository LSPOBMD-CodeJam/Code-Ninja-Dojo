JavaScript TDD with Jasmine
---

Preparation
    Everyone to pull the code for todays jam from the Code-Ninja-Dojo github
    repository
    Have your favourite editor/IDE at the ready
    
Exercise
    Part 1
	There is some JavaScript code (widgets.js) that doesn't have any tests
	around it. The code should allow you to only select the colour of a
	widget if the value of the number of widgets is greater than 0. There is
	currently no test for this code. This code makes use of jQuery.
	    Your challenge is to write one and make it pass.
    Part 2
	We need to add some new functionality to the page. Currently no error
	message appears if the user clicks the 'OK' button without selecting a
	colour or entering a value. The message we would like to see is "Please
	enter the number of widgets" and "Please select a colour".
	    Your challenge is to write the new functionality using TDD.
